                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p1" q="What is POP exactly?" a="POP stands for Plaster of Paris. It is a quick-setting gypsum plaster that we use to create decorative ceilings and moldings." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p2" q="Is POP fire resistant?" a="Yes, gypsum is naturally fire-resistant and acts as a barrier against heat, providing extra safety for your home." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p3" q="Does a POP ceiling make a room hotter?" a="On the contrary, the air gap between the concrete slab and the POP ceiling acts as thermal insulation, keeping the room cooler." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p4" q="Can I install heavy chandeliers on a POP ceiling?" a="Chandeliers should be anchored to the main concrete slab or a structural beam, not the POP itself. We plan these support points during installation." %}

                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p8" q="What causes cracks in POP ceilings?" a="Cracks usually occur due to structural movement of the building or poor mixing of materials. Our master plasterers use reinforced fibers to prevent this." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p9" q="How long does a POP ceiling last?" a="With proper maintenance and no water leaks, a Sellux POP ceiling will last the lifetime of the building." %}
