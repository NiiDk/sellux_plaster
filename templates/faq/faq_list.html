                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d1" q="What is the difference between architectural finishing and decorating?" a="Architectural finishing involves the structural surface work—like installing plasterboard partitions, suspended ceilings, and technical skimming. Decorating focuses on the aesthetic 'layer' like furniture and paint." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d2" q="Do you offer 3D visualizations before work starts?" a="Yes, for bespoke commissions like custom T.V. units or tiered ceilings, we provide 3D renders to help you visualize the geometry and lighting layouts before installation." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d3" q="Can I provide my own design?" a="Absolutely. Our team can work with architect blueprints, CAD drawings, or even inspiration photos to engineer the exact structural framework required for the look." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d4" q="How long does a typical plasterboard ceiling project take?" a="A standard living room installation usually takes 3-5 days. Full residential or commercial finishing projects vary between 2-4 weeks depending on complexity." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d5" q="Do you work on commercial office spaces?" a="Yes. We specialize in commercial Grade-A finishes, including acoustic partitions and grid suspension systems for high-traffic office environments across Ghana." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d6" q="Is there a fee for on-site measurement?" a="We offer professional site inspections within Accra. This allows us to recommend the correct material thickness (0.40mm vs 0.50mm) for your specific structural needs." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d8" q="What is Minimalist design in modern plastering?" a="Modern minimalism uses 'Shadow Gaps' and recessed Z-Trims to create the illusion of floating ceilings, moving away from traditional heavy moldings for a cleaner, architectural look." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="d10" q="Do you offer painting services as well?" a="We provide a glass-smooth 'paint-ready' finish. Upon request, we can handle the final painting to ensure our high-quality skimming is protected and finished perfectly." %}

                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p1" q="What is Drywall/Plasterboard?" a="Plasterboard consists of a core of gypsum pressed between heavy sheets of paper. It is the global standard for creating perfectly flat, fire-resistant, and sound-insulated walls and ceilings." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p2" q="Are your ceiling systems fire resistant?" a="Yes. We supply and install specialized Fire-Resistant boards (Red Board) designed to protect structural members and provide extra safety in high-risk areas." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p3" q="Does a suspended ceiling improve room temperature?" a="Yes. The air gap between the structural slab and our plasterboard system acts as a thermal buffer, significantly reducing heat transfer and keeping rooms cooler." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p4" q="Can I install heavy chandeliers on a plasterboard ceiling?" a="Heavy fixtures must be anchored to the concrete slab or our primary Main Channel framework using Still Dowels, not the board itself. We plan these support points during the framing phase." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p7" q="Can plasterboard be used in bathrooms?" a="In high-moisture areas, we exclusively use Moisture Resistant (M.R.) 'Green Boards' which feature a water-repellent core to prevent sagging and mold growth." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p8" q="How do you prevent cracks at the joints?" a="We use high-tensile fiberglass Mesh Tape on every joint and reinforce external corners with Perforated Angle Channels before applying our premium skimming compound." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="p12" q="Can plasterboard ceilings be curved?" a="Yes. While boards are flat, our artisans can use specialized 'kerfing' techniques or multi-layered thin boards to create domes, arches, and organic architectural shapes." %}

                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="m2" q="Do you sell P.O.P and Plasterboard materials separately?" a="Yes. Our supply division provides P.O.P bags, cornices, gypsum boards, and all associated fixings (screws, tapes, and channels) to contractors and homeowners." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="m3" q="What is the difference between P.O.P supply and Plasterboard?" a="P.O.P (Plaster of Paris) is a raw powder used for hand-molding decorative elements. Plasterboard consists of factory-made sheets that offer faster installation and superior fire/acoustic ratings." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="m7" q="What is 'Skimming' vs 'Screeding'?" a="Screeding levels the floor or rough walls, while Skimming is the final application of a fine compound (like Sellux Skimming Powder) to create a perfectly smooth surface for paint." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="m8" q="Do you supply decorative P.O.P elements?" a="Yes. We stock a variety of P.O.P Corner Moulds and Center Panels for clients looking to add traditional architectural detail to their spaces." %}

                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="ma2" q="What if I have a water leak?" a="Fix the leak source immediately. Once dry, we can precisely cut out the affected plasterboard section and patch it seamlessly without replacing the entire ceiling." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="ma4" q="Can I install AC vents or Access Panels later?" a="Yes. We recommend installing Sellux Access Panels during the initial build to allow easy maintenance of HVAC and electrical systems without damaging the finish." %}
                        {% include 'includes/faq_item.html' with id="ma5" q="Is plasterboard prone to insects or mold?" a="No. Our gypsum boards are inorganic, meaning they do not provide a food source for termites. Using M.R. boards in wet areas also prevents mold growth." %}
