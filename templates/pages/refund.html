                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-dark">1. Material Returns</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Standard materials from our catalogue (e.g., gypsum boards, metal profiles) can be returned within 7 days if the packaging is unopened and the product is in its original condition. A 10% restocking fee may apply.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-dark">2. Custom Items</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Bespoke cornices or custom-moulded designs are non-refundable once production has commenced, as these are made specifically to your architectural requirements.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-dark">3. Service Refunds</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-4">Refunds for professional services (installation, skimming) are handled on a case-by-case basis. If you are dissatisfied with the quality of work, our team will perform remedial actions to meet your satisfaction as per the contract.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-dark">4. Refund Process</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-0">Approved refunds will be processed within 5-10 business days via the original payment method (Paystack or Bank Transfer).</p>
